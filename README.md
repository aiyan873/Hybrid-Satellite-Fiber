# Performance-Analysis-of-Hybrid-Satellite-Fiber-Networks
Remote and rural regions face significant challenges
in establishing reliable high-speed communication networks due
to geographical constraints and infrastructure limitations. This
paper presents a comprehensive performance evaluation of hy-
brid satellite-fiber networks that leverage geostationary satellite
links for initial connectivity and fiber optic backhaul for high-
throughput data transmission. We develop a detailed simula-
tion framework in MATLAB to analyze network performance
under varying modulation schemes including BPSK, QPSK,
16QAM, and 64QAM across multiple bandwidth allocations
ranging from 1 MHz to 100 MHz. Our results demonstrate that
satellite links exhibit propagation delays of approximately 477
milliseconds while fiber connections maintain sub-2 millisecond
latency. The proposed adaptive handoff mechanism achieves
seamless transition between satellite and fiber segments at the
60-second mark with minimal packet loss. Performance metrics
including throughput, end-to-end latency, packet delivery ratio,
and spectral efficiency are quantified across 24 distinct network
configurations. The findings indicate that hybrid architectures
can effectively balance coverage requirements with performance
demands for remote connectivity applications.
